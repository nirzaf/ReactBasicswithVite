React 19
Introduction
React 19 is the latest stable version of the popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Vite is a modern build tool that offers blazing-fast development environment and optimized production builds. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to set up React 19 with Vite to create a fast, modern web application development environment.

Why Use Vite?
Lightning-fast hot module replacement
No bundling during development
Optimized builds with Rollup
Out-of-the-box TypeScript support
React 19 Features
React Compiler for improved performance
New server-side rendering architecture
Enhanced concurrent features
Improved developer experience
Prerequisites
Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js - version 18.0.0 or higher (preferably version 20+)
npm or yarn package manager
A code editor (VS Code recommended)
 Tip: To check your Node.js version, open your terminal and run:

node -vCopy
Step-by-Step Installation
1
Create a New Vite Project
Open your terminal and run the following command:

npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template reactCopy
Replace my-react-app with your desired project name.

2
Navigate to Your Project Directory
cd my-react-appCopy
3
Upgrade to React 19
By default, Vite might create a project with React 18. Let's upgrade to React 19:

npm install react@^19.0.0 react-dom@^19.0.0Copy
 Note: The videos showed installing React 19 as it had just been released. In the future, Vite's React template might include React 19 by default.

4
Install React Compiler (Optional)
To leverage the new React Compiler features in React 19, you can install the Babel plugin:

npm install -D @babel/plugin-react-compilerCopy
5
Configure Vite to Use React Compiler
Open the vite.config.js file in your project directory and modify it to include the React Compiler plugin:

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'; import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'; export default defineConfig({ plugins: [ react({ babel: { plugins: ['@babel/plugin-react-compiler'] } }) ], });Copy
6
Change Default Port (Optional)
By default, Vite runs on port 5173. If you prefer the traditional React port 3000, modify your vite.config.js file:

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'; import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'; export default defineConfig({ plugins: [ react({ babel: { plugins: ['@babel/plugin-react-compiler'] } }) ], server: { port: 3000 }, });Copy
7
Install Dependencies and Start the Development Server
Install all project dependencies and start the development server:

npm installCopy
npm run devCopy
Your React 19 app should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or port 5173 if you didn't change it).

Verifying React 19 Installation
To verify that your project is using React 19, you can display the React version in your app:

// In your App.jsx file import React, { version } from 'react'; function App() { return (
React 19 with Vite
Current React Version: {version}
); } export default App;Copy
This will display the current React version in your app, confirming that React 19 is properly installed.

Troubleshooting
Package Version Conflicts
If you encounter version conflicts, try clearing your npm cache and reinstalling:

npm cache clean --forceCopy
npm installCopy
Compiler Plugin Issues
If the React Compiler plugin causes issues, you can remove it and still use React 19 without the compiler features:

Remove the plugin from your vite.config.js file
Uninstall the package: npm uninstall @babel/plugin-react-compiler
Next Steps
Add Dependencies
Consider adding these popular libraries to your React 19 project:

React Router for navigation
Tailwind CSS for styling
Axios for API requests
Project Structure
Organize your project with these folders:

src/components/ - Reusable components
src/pages/ - Page components
src/hooks/ - Custom React hooks
src/context/ - Context providers
